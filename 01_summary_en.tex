\section*{Summary}
\subsection*{Developing a Teamwork Platform}
The goal of this final thesis is to develop a web application that will serve as a platform for teamwork on various projects. The \textit{Teamstructor} application was developed using the Laravel framework. In the mentioned application, users can form teams in which team members have access to the projects the team is working on. Within each project, team members have access to the project discussion - a place suitable for sharing all news and updates related to that project and access to shared project resources - files uploaded by team members. A simple administrative interface is also implemented. This paper will present the technologies that were used and the way in which the application was implemented.
